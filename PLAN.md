# Excel Pilot Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Excel Pilot is a financial data analysis tool that allows users to upload spreadsheets (CSV, XLSX) and PDFs, analyze the data using AI-powered insights, and automate accounting workflows. The application uses DuckDB WASM for client-side data processing and provides a chat interface for natural language queries.

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… Completed Components
1. **UI Framework**: Next.js 13.5 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
2. **File Upload**: Basic file parser for CSV/XLSX with client-side processing
3. **Database Layer**: DuckDB WASM integration for both client and server
4. **Basic UI**: 
   - File uploader component
   - Split layout with data viewer and chat panel
   - Data table, charts, and quick stats components
   - Chat interface with message display
5. **State Management**: Zustand store for application state

### ðŸ”„ Mocked/Incomplete Components
1. **API Routes**: All endpoints return mock data or simplified responses
2. **Chat Functionality**: Basic pattern matching instead of AI integration
3. **Action Execution**: Returns mock artifacts instead of generating real documents
4. **Data Analysis**: Limited to basic SQL queries, no advanced analytics
5. **File Parsing**: PDF parsing is placeholder only
6. **Authentication**: No user management or session handling

## Notes

- The application already has a solid foundation with UI components and DuckDB integration
- Focus should be on replacing mocked functionality with real implementations
- Prioritize features based on user feedback and business requirements
- Consider starting with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on Phases 1-3
- Security and compliance should be considered from the beginning, not as an afterthought
