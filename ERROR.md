Can you create a report of the top 10 vendors?

17:03

I understood your question and generated this SQL query:

```sql
SELECT company, COUNT(*) as customer_count, SUM(balance) as total_balance, AVG(balance) as avg_balance FROM dataset_1755982999896_customers WHERE company IS NOT NULL GROUP BY company ORDER BY total_balance DESC LIMIT 10",
  "explanation": "This query identifies the top 10 vendors (companies) by total balance owed. It groups customers by company, counts the number of customers per company, calculates total and average balances, and orders by total balance in descending order to show the highest-value vendors first.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Which vendors have the highest average balance per customer?",
    "Show vendors with overdue payments (past due_date)?",
    "What is the distribution of customers across all vendors?",
    "Which vendors have the most customers regardless of balance?"
  ]
}
```
```

However, the query failed with error: Parser Error: syntax error at or near "",
  ""

LINE 1: ... NOT NULL GROUP BY company ORDER BY total_balance DESC LIMIT 10",
                                                                          ^

Let me try a different approach or please refine your question.
