# SheetPilot â€” AI Accounting Assistant for SMBs

Our prototype makes financial data accessible to anyone, not just those with an accounting degree or data background. By simply uploading everyday spreadsheetsâ€”like overdue balances, inventory, or a general ledgerâ€”the system automatically surfaces insights, sends invoices, flags low stock, or even automates purchasing. This saves small business owners time, reduces errors, and empowers them to make smarter decisions without complex tools or training.

> ExcelPilot turns everyday CSV/XLSX files into automated accounting workflows: send invoices from overdue balances, generate low-stock purchase orders from inventory **and even automatically purchase**, or run forensic checks on your general ledger â€” all in seconds.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem

Despite the explosion of accounting software, most small businesses still rely on **manual spreadsheets and ad-hoc processes**:

* According to surveys by SMB Group and QuickBooks, **over 70% of small businesses still use Excel or Google Sheets** as their primary finance tool.
* Only **1 in 5 SMBs adopt full accounting platforms** like NetSuite or SAP â€” citing cost, complexity, and steep learning curves.
* Manual processes mean missed invoices, stockouts, and countless hours lost reconciling ledgers every month.

Accounting software is often too expensive, too complex, and ultimately under-utilized â€” leaving small businesses stuck in Excel.
